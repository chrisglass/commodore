= Command Line Options

== Generic Options

Some command line options aren't associated with a specific command, but can
provided to any command instead.

*--version*::
  Show the version and exit.

*-v, --verbose*::
  Control verbosity. Can be repeated for more verbose output. Can also be
  provided after subcommands (for example `commodore catalog compile -v`).
+
Currently three verbosity levels are implemented, regular operation is
active when the flag isn't provided, debug verbosity is enabled when the
flag is provided once or more, and trace verbosity is enabled when the flag
is provided three times or more.

*--help*::
  Show help message for generic options and available commands then exit.

== Catalog Clean

This command doesn't have any command line options.

== Catalog Compile

*--api-url* URL::
  xref:lieutenant:ROOT:index.adoc[Lieutenant] API URL.

*--api-token* TOKEN::
  Lieutenant API token.

*--global-git-base* URL::
  Base directory for global Git configuration repositories.
+
The name of the global configuration repository is provided by the cluster
definition returned by the Lieutenant API. Commodore will construct the global
configuration repository URL `GLOBAL_GIT_BASE/<cluster_base_config>.git`,
where `cluster_base_config` is the value provided by the cluster definition in
field `base_config`.
+
By default, Commodore also uses the global Git base URL when doing component
autodiscovery. Components are searched in
`GLOBAL_GIT_BASE/commodore-components`, unless specified otherwise in the
configuration, see
xref:reference/architecture.adoc#_component_discovery[Component discovery].

*--local*::
  Run in local mode. Intended to be used to test/verify local changes (for
  example during component development) against an existing cluster inventory
  and catalog.
+
Local mode doesn't try to connect to the Lieutenant API or fetch/push Git
repositories. However, local mode expects the working directory to contain a
valid inventory in `inventory/` and all the dependencies (components and
Jsonnet libraries) required by the
inventory in `dependencies/`, with component classes symlinked to `inventory/`
and component and 3rd party Jsonnet libraries symlinked to `dependencies/lib`.
+
In local mode, uncommitted modifications to the inventory and dependencies are
never discarded.
+
Local mode will fail when the cluster id of the inventory differs from the
cluster id for which compilation was requested.
+
If `catalog/` is provided for a local mode compilation, Commodore will show a
diff of the changes compared to the provided catalog. There's currently no
mechanism that ensures that the provided cluster catalog actually matches the
cluster for which compilation was requested.
+
The quickest way to get a working directory setup for local mode is to run
a "regular" `catalog compile` for the cluster you want to work against.
+
See also xref:local-mode.adoc[local mode documentation].

*--push*::
  Push catalog to remote repository as discovered in the cluster configuration
  fetched from the Lieutenant API.

*--interactive*::
  Show changes and prompt if they should be pushed to the remote repository.
  This doesn't do anything unless `--push` is provided.

*--git-author-name* USERNAME::
  Name of catalog commit author

*--git-author-email* EMAIL::
  E-mail address of catalog commit author

*--help*::
  Show catalog clean usage and options then exit.

== Catalog Clean

This command doesn't have any command line options.

== Component Compile

*-f, --values* FILE::
  Specify inventory class in a YAML file. This option can be repeated to
  provide multiple files. Files specified later win when resolving inventory
  values.

*-J, --search-paths* DIRECTORY::
  Specify additional search paths.

*-o, --output* DIRECTORY::
  Specify output path for compiled component. Defaults to `./`.

*--help*::
  Show catalog compile usage and options then exit.

== Component New

*--name* TEXT::
  The component's name as it will be written in the documentation. Defaults to the slug.

*--lib / --no-lib*::
  Add a component library template. Defaults to _no_.

*--pp / --no-pp*::
  Add a component postprocessing template. Defaults to _no_.

*--owner* TEXT::
  The GitHub user or project name where the component will be hosted. Defaults
  to _projectsyn_.

*--copyright* TEXT::
  The copyright holder added to the license file. Defaults to "VSHN AG <info@vshn.ch>".

*--help*::
  Show component new usage and options then exit.
